# About
HaxLib is a discord Library that will have a ruby and Python version, so it's easier to port bots between the 2

# Why use HaxLib
It's a project for fun, I don't think you should use and I personally think you should use [this](https://github.com/HuyaneMatsu/hata) for python and [this](https://github.com/discordrb/discordrb) for ruby instead

# Support
You can get support at [our support server]()
